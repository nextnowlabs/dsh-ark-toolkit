/**
 * Transparent routing for the host model selector: when `imageInputVariants.hidden`
 * is enabled, variant routes keep the upstream provider/model display names and
 * the browser hides the upstream text-only entries that have a variant twin.
 * Users then see one entry per model — the original name — while the session
 * actually runs on the image-capable variant, so pasted images, history with
 * images, and the built-in `read_image` tool all keep working on text-only
 * models without exposing `(Ark Toolkit)` routes.
 *
 * The host selector renders one `[role=group]` per provider whose group title
 * id is `:<react-radix>:-<providerId>`, and one `[role=menuitemradio]` per
 * model. We key groups by that provider id (variant routes carry the
 * `ark-toolkit-` prefix) and hide every upstream entry whose display name
 * matches a variant twin, collapsing fully-hidden upstream groups.
 *
 * The hiding decision is purely DOM-local: transparent mode is exactly the
 * case where a variant twin keeps the upstream display name, while explicit
 * mode appends `(Ark Toolkit)` and therefore never matches. No display-config
 * round-trip is needed before the selector can be tidied, so the first paint
 * of an opened menu already shows the merged list instead of flashing the
 * duplicate upstream group.
